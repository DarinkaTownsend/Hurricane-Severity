Fallen trees are a common source of damage during high wind events, as they can break through fences and other barriers, leading to injuries and property damage. The severity of the damage suggests that this event was likely a high wind storm, which can cause such destruction. The playground's condition indicates that it will require substantial repair work before it can be safely used again."
